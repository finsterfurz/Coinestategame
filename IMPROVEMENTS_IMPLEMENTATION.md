- All critical user interactions tested
- Accessibility compliance verified
- Error scenarios covered
```

### Code Quality Metrics
```
🎯 Quality Improvements:
- TypeScript coverage: 100%

```

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture Improvements

### State Management Architecture
```typescript
// Before: localStorage-based scattered state
const characters = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('characters') || '[]');

// After: Centralized Zustand store with TypeScript
const characters = useGameStore(state => state.characters);
const addCharacter = useGameStore(state => state.addCharacter);
```

### Error Handling Architecture
```typescript
// Before: Basic error boundaries
<ErrorBoundary>
  <Component />
</ErrorBoundary>

// After: Enhanced error boundaries with retry
<CriticalErrorBoundary>
  <PageErrorBoundary>
    <ComponentErrorBoundary>
      <Component />
    </ComponentErrorBoundary>
  </PageErrorBoundary>
</CriticalErrorBoundary>
```

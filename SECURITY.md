## Security Measures

### üõ°Ô∏è Defense in Depth

Our security approach uses multiple layers of protection:

#### Layer 1: Smart Contract Security
- **Audited Contracts**: All contracts audited by reputable firms
- **Formal Verification**: Critical functions formally verified
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with multi-sig requirements
- **Pausable Mechanisms**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Upgrade Patterns**: Secure upgrade mechanisms where needed

#### Layer 2: Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **XSS Protection**: Multiple XSS prevention mechanisms
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of dependencies

#### Layer 3: Infrastructure Security
- **DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare protection enabled
- **Rate Limiting**: API and transaction rate limits
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring
- **Backup Systems**: Secure, encrypted backups
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls for all systems

## Smart Contract Security

### üîç Security Audits

#### Completed Audits
- **Audit Firm**: [Audit Report 1](./audits/audit-1.pdf)
- **Audit Firm**: [Audit Report 2](./audits/audit-2.pdf)
- **Internal Review**: [Internal Security Review](./audits/internal-review.pdf)

#### Ongoing Security Measures

```solidity
// Example security patterns implemented
contract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, AccessControl {
    // Multiple security modifiers
    modifier onlyAuthorized() {
        require(hasRole(AUTHORIZED_ROLE, msg.sender), "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    
    modifier validAmount(uint256 amount) {
        require(amount > 0 && amount <= MAX_AMOUNT, "Invalid amount");
        _;
    }
    
    // Safe state changes
    function secureFunction() 
        external 
        nonReentrant 
        whenNotPaused 
        onlyAuthorized 
    {
        // Implementation with security checks
    }
}
```

### üîí Access Control

| Role | Permissions | Multi-sig Required |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Owner** | Contract upgrades, emergency pause | ‚úÖ 3/5 |
| **Minter** | Token minting | ‚ùå |
| **Operator** | Game operations | ‚ùå |
| **Pauser** | Emergency pause | ‚úÖ 2/3 |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Centralization Risks**
   - Owner can pause contracts
   - Minting controlled by authorized addresses
   - Mitigation: Multi-sig wallets, time-locks

2. **Oracle Dependencies**
   - Price feeds from external oracles
   - Mitigation: Multiple oracle sources, fallback mechanisms

3. **Gas Limit Risks**
   - Large operations may hit gas limits
   - Mitigation: Batch operations, gas optimization

---

## Frontend Security

### üåê Web Security Headers

```http
# Security headers implemented
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

### üîê Web3 Security

#### MetaMask Integration
- **Secure Connection**: Only HTTPS origins
- **Permission Requests**: Explicit user consent
- **Transaction Validation**: All parameters verified
- **Network Validation**: Correct network enforcement

#### Input Validation
```javascript
// Example input validation
const validateAddress = (address) => {
  if (!ethers.utils.isAddress(address)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid Ethereum address');
  }
  return address.toLowerCase();
};

const validateAmount = (amount) => {
  const parsed = ethers.utils.parseEther(amount.toString());
  if (parsed.lte(0)) {
    throw new Error('Amount must be positive');
  }
  return parsed;
};
```

### üì± Client-Side Security

- **Local Storage**: No sensitive data stored locally
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging**: No private keys or sensitive data logged
